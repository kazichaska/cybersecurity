# Active Directory Best Practices

Active Directory (AD) is a critical component of many organizations' IT infrastructure. Following best practices ensures that your AD environment is secure, scalable, and easy to manage.

## Fully Understand the Organizational Structure and Potential Growth

### Assess Current and Future Needs
- **Understand the Current Structure**:
  - Map out the existing organizational units (OUs), groups, and user accounts.
  - Identify key stakeholders and their roles within the organization.

- **Plan for Future Growth**:
  - Consider potential mergers, acquisitions, or expansions.
  - Plan for additional OUs, groups, and user accounts as the organization grows.

### Example
- **Current Structure**:
  - Corporate OU
    - HR Group
    - IT Group
    - Sales Group

- **Future Growth**:
  - New Regional Offices
  - Additional Departments

## Opt for a Simpler Design

### Keep It Simple
- **Minimize Complexity**:
  - Use a flat OU structure where possible.
  - Avoid deep nesting of OUs and groups.

- **Use Group Policies Wisely**:
  - Apply Group Policy Objects (GPOs) at the highest level necessary.
  - Avoid excessive use of GPOs to prevent conflicts and complexity.

### Example
- **Simple OU Structure**:
  - Corporate OU
    - HR Group
    - IT Group
    - Sales Group

## Design the AD Infrastructure to Scale with Growth

### Plan for Scalability
- **Use Sites and Subnets**:
  - Define sites and subnets to optimize replication and authentication traffic.
  - Place domain controllers in strategic locations to ensure high availability.

- **Implement Redundancy**:
  - Deploy multiple domain controllers to provide fault tolerance.
  - Ensure that each site has at least one domain controller.

### Example
- **Sites and Subnets**:
  - Corporate Site
    - Subnet: 192.168.1.0/24
  - Regional Office Site
    - Subnet: 192.168.2.0/24

## Test All GPOs in a Lab or Staging Environment Before Deploying

### Testing GPOs
- **Create a Lab Environment**:
  - Set up a lab environment that mirrors the production environment.
  - Test all GPOs in the lab environment before deploying them to production.

- **Use Staging**:
  - Deploy GPOs to a staging environment for further testing.
  - Monitor the impact of GPOs in the staging environment before full deployment.

### Example
- **Lab Environment**:
  - Virtual machines replicating the production AD structure.
  - Test GPOs for security settings, software deployment, and user configurations.

## Document the AD Structure, Policies, Permissions, and Any Changes

### Documentation
- **Maintain Comprehensive Documentation**:
  - Document the AD structure, including OUs, groups, and user accounts.
  - Record all GPOs, their settings, and their intended effects.

- **Track Changes**:
  - Keep a change log of all modifications to the AD environment.
  - Include details such as the date, the change made, and the person responsible.

### Example
- **Documentation**:
  - AD Structure Diagram
  - GPO Settings and Descriptions
  - Change Log

## Explain How Active Directory is Used to Manage Enterprise-Scale Environments

Active Directory is used to manage enterprise-scale environments by providing a centralized and standardized system for managing users, computers, and other resources. It allows administrators to enforce security policies, manage permissions, and ensure compliance across the organization.

### Key Features
- **Centralized Management**:
  - Manage all users, computers, and resources from a single interface.
  - Apply policies and permissions consistently across the organization.

- **Scalability**:
  - Easily scale to accommodate thousands of users and devices.
  - Support for multiple domains and forests.

## Define Domain Controllers as Servers That Manage AD Authentication and Authorization

Domain controllers are servers that manage Active Directory authentication and authorization. They store the AD database and handle login requests, ensuring that users are authenticated and granted access to resources based on their permissions.

### Key Functions
- **Authentication**:
  - Verify user credentials during login.
  - Issue Kerberos tickets for secure authentication.

- **Authorization**:
  - Determine user permissions based on group memberships and policies.
  - Enforce access controls to resources.

## Use Active Directory Tools to Create Organizational Units, Users, and Groups

Active Directory tools, such as the Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) console, allow administrators to create and manage organizational units (OUs), users, and groups.

### Steps to Create OUs, Users, and Groups

1. **Open ADUC**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `dsa.msc`, and press Enter.

2. **Create an Organizational Unit**:
   - Right-click on the domain or an existing OU, select "New", and then "Organizational Unit".
   - Enter a name for the OU and click "OK".

3. **Create a User**:
   - Right-click on the desired OU, select "New", and then "User".
   - Follow the wizard to enter user details and set a password.

4. **Create a Group**:
   - Right-click on the desired OU, select "New", and then "Group".
   - Enter a name for the group and select the group scope and type.

## Create and Link Group Policy Objects That Enforce Domain-Hardening Policies

Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are used to enforce security settings and configurations across the domain. Administrators can create and link GPOs to OUs, domains, or sites to apply policies.

### Steps to Create and Link GPOs

1. **Open Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `gpmc.msc`, and press Enter.

2. **Create a New GPO**:
   - Right-click on the desired OU, domain, or site, and select "Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here".
   - Enter a name for the GPO and click "OK".

3. **Edit the GPO**:
   - Right-click on the newly created GPO and select "Edit".
   - Configure the desired policies under "Computer Configuration" or "User Configuration".

4. **Link the GPO**:
   - The GPO is automatically linked to the selected OU, domain, or site when created.
   - You can also link existing GPOs by right-clicking on the desired OU, domain, or site and selecting "Link an Existing GPO".
