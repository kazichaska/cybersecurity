# Introduction to Windows and Command Line

## 1. Leverage the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) to Navigate and Manage Directories and Files

### Navigating the File System

- **Change Directory**
  ```cmd
  cd path\to\directory
  ```
  - Example:
    ```cmd
    cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents
    ```

- **List Directory Contents**
  ```cmd
  dir
  ```

- **Go to the Parent Directory**
  ```cmd
  cd ..
  ```

### File and Directory Management

- **Create a Directory**
  ```cmd
  mkdir directory_name
  ```
  - Example:
    ```cmd
    mkdir NewFolder
    ```

- **Remove a Directory**
  ```cmd
  rmdir directory_name
  ```
  - Example:
    ```cmd
    rmdir OldFolder
    ```

- **Create a File**
  ```cmd
  echo. > filename.txt
  ```
  - Example:
    ```cmd
    echo. > newfile.txt
    ```

- **Delete a File**
  ```cmd
  del filename.txt
  ```
  - Example:
    ```cmd
    del oldfile.txt
    ```

### Viewing and Editing Files

- **View File Contents**
  ```cmd
  type filename.txt
  ```
  - Example:
    ```cmd
    type example.txt
    ```

- **Edit a File with Notepad**
  ```cmd
  notepad filename.txt
  ```
  - Example:
    ```cmd
    notepad example.txt
    ```

## 2. Explain How Windows Stores Files

Windows stores files in a hierarchical file system structure. The top level is the root directory, typically represented by a drive letter (e.g., `C:\`). Under the root directory, there are folders (directories) and subfolders that organize files. Each file and folder has a unique path that specifies its location within the file system. Windows uses the NTFS (New Technology File System) for storing files, which supports features like file permissions, encryption, and compression.

## 3. Create, Manage, and View User Information Using the Command-Line Tool `net`

### Create a New User
```cmd
net user username password /add
```
- Example:
  ```cmd
  net user newuser password123 /add
  ```

### Delete a User
```cmd
net user username /delete
```
- Example:
  ```cmd
  net user newuser /delete
  ```

### View User Information
```cmd
net user username
```
- Example:
  ```cmd
  net user newuser
  ```

## 4. Manage Password Policies Using `gpedit`

The Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`) is a Windows tool used to configure and manage system policies, including password policies.

### Open Group Policy Editor
1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
2. Type `gpedit.msc` and press Enter.

### Configure Password Policies
1. In the Group Policy Editor, navigate to:
   ```
   Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Account Policies -> Password Policy
   ```
2. Configure the desired password policies, such as password length, complexity requirements, and expiration.

## 5. Optionally, Schedule Tasks Using Task Scheduler

The Task Scheduler allows you to automate tasks to run at specific times or intervals.

### Open Task Scheduler
1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
2. Type `taskschd.msc` and press Enter.

### Create a Basic Task
1. In the Task Scheduler, click on "Create Basic Task" in the Actions pane.
2. Follow the wizard to set up the task, including the name, trigger (schedule), and action (command or script to run).

### Example: Schedule a Script to Run Daily
1. Open Task Scheduler.
2. Click "Create Basic Task".
3. Name the task (e.g., "Daily Backup").
4. Set the trigger to "Daily" and specify the time.
5. Set the action to "Start a program" and browse to the script you want to run.
6. Finish the wizard to create the task.

## Today's Activities

### Audit Processes with Task Manager

1. Open Task Manager by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + Esc`.
2. Review the list of running processes.
3. Identify any processes that are using a high amount of resources.

### Use the Command Line to Gather Information and Create Files

1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Use the `systeminfo` command to gather system information:
   ```cmd
   systeminfo
   ```
3. Create a new file using the `echo` command:
   ```cmd
   echo This is a test file. > testfile.txt
   ```

### Enforce Password Policies

1. Open Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`).
2. Navigate to `Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Account Policies -> Password Policy`.
3. Set policies for password length, complexity, and expiration.

### Manage Users

1. Create a new user:
   ```cmd
   net user newuser password123 /add
   ```
2. Delete a user:
   ```cmd
   net user newuser /delete
   ```
3. View user information:
   ```cmd
   net user newuser
   ```

### Automate Tasks

1. Open Task Scheduler (`taskschd.msc`).
2. Create a new task to run a script daily.
3. Follow the wizard to set up the task.

This document provides a comprehensive guide to leveraging the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) for navigating and managing directories and files, explaining how Windows stores files, creating and managing user information using the `net` command, managing password policies using `gpedit`, and optionally scheduling tasks using Task Scheduler. It also includes activities for auditing processes, gathering information, enforcing password policies, managing users, and automating tasks.
