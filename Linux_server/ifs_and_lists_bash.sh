# Bash Scripting: IFS and Lists

## Read Bash and Interpret Scripts

Bash scripts are read and interpreted line by line by the Bash shell. Each line in the script is executed in sequence.

### Example Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

## Use Variables in Your Bash Scripts

Variables allow you to store and manipulate data within your scripts.

### Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
name="John"
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

## Use `if` Statements in Your Bash Scripts

`if` statements allow you to execute commands conditionally based on the evaluation of an expression.

### Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ -f /etc/passwd ]; then
  echo "The passwd file exists."
else
  echo "The passwd file does not exist."
fi
```

## Use Lists in Your Bash Scripts

Lists allow you to store multiple values in a single variable.

### Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry")
echo "First fruit: ${fruits[0]}"
echo "All fruits: ${fruits[@]}"
```

## Iterate Through Lists with a `for` Loop to Do Useful Things

`for` loops allow you to iterate through lists and perform actions on each item.

### Example: Install a List of Packages
```bash
#!/bin/bash
packages=("curl" "wget" "git")
for package in "${packages[@]}"; do
  sudo apt-get install -y $package
done
```
