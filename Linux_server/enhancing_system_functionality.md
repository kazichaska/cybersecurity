# Enhancing System Functionality

## Backups and Restoring Data with `tar`

### Identify and Describe Use Cases for the Three Kinds of Backups

1. **Full Backup**
   - **Description**: A complete copy of all data and files.
   - **Use Case**: Best for initial backups or when a comprehensive backup is required.
   - **Pros**: Simplifies restoration as all data is in one place.
   - **Cons**: Time-consuming and requires significant storage space.

2. **Incremental Backup**
   - **Description**: Backs up only the data that has changed since the last backup.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for daily backups to save time and storage.
   - **Pros**: Faster and requires less storage compared to full backups.
   - **Cons**: Restoration can be complex as it requires the last full backup and all incremental backups.

3. **Differential Backup**
   - **Description**: Backs up data that has changed since the last full backup.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for mid-week backups to balance between full and incremental backups.
   - **Pros**: Easier to restore than incremental backups.
   - **Cons**: Requires more storage than incremental backups but less than full backups.

### Create (tar) an Archive from Existing Files and Directories

- **Command**:
  ```sh
  tar -cvzf archive_name.tar.gz /path/to/directory_or_files
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sh
  tar -cvzf backup_2023_10_01.tar.gz /home/user/documents
  ```

### List and Search the Contents of an Existing Archive

- **List Contents**:
  ```sh
  tar -tvf archive_name.tar.gz
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sh
  tar -tvf backup_2023_10_01.tar.gz
  ```

- **Search Contents**:
  ```sh
  tar -tvf archive_name.tar.gz | grep search_term
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sh
  tar -tvf backup_2023_10_01.tar.gz | grep "important_file.txt"
  ```

### Extract (untar) the Contents of an Archive

- **Command**:
  ```sh
  tar -xvzf archive_name.tar.gz -C /path/to/extract
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sh
  tar -xvzf backup_2023_10_01.tar.gz -C /home/user/restored_documents
  ```

### Describe and Demonstrate Two Exploits for the `tar` Command

1. **Path Traversal Vulnerability**
   - **Description**: Malicious tar files can include paths that traverse directories, potentially overwriting critical system files.
   - **Exploit**:
     ```sh
     tar -cvzf exploit.tar.gz ../../../../etc/passwd
     ```
   - **Mitigation**: Always inspect tar file contents before extraction and use the `--strip-components` option to remove leading directory components.

2. **Symlink Attack**
   - **Description**: Malicious tar files can include symbolic links that point to sensitive files, causing them to be overwritten during extraction.
   - **Exploit**:
     ```sh
     ln -s /etc/passwd symlink
     tar -cvzf exploit.tar.gz symlink
     ```
   - **Mitigation**: Use the `--dereference` option when creating tar files to avoid including symlinks and inspect tar file contents before extraction.

## Cron and Scheduled Jobs

### Schedule Regular Jobs for Individual Users with `crontab`

- **Edit Crontab for Current User**:
  ```sh
  crontab -e
  ```

- **Crontab Syntax**:
  ```
  * * * * * command_to_execute
  ```

  - **Fields**:
    - `*`: Minute (0-59)
    - `*`: Hour (0-23)
    - `*`: Day of the month (1-31)
    - `*`: Month (1-12)
    - `*`: Day of the week (0-7, where both 0 and 7 represent Sunday)

- **Example**: Schedule a script to run every day at midnight
  ```sh
  0 0 * * * /path/to/script.sh
  ```

### Write Simple Scripts for Maintenance and Security Tasks

- **Example Maintenance Script** (`maintenance.sh`):
  ```sh
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Starting maintenance tasks..."
  apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
  echo "Maintenance tasks completed."
  ```

- **Example Security Script** (`security_check.sh`):
  ```sh
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Starting security checks..."
  # Check for unauthorized access
  grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log
  echo "Security checks completed."
  ```

### Use `cron` to Automate the Execution of Security Scripts

- **Schedule Maintenance Script**:
  ```sh
  crontab -e
  ```

  - Add the following line to run the maintenance script every Sunday at 2 AM:
    ```sh
    0 2 * * 0 /path/to/maintenance.sh
    ```

- **Schedule Security Script**:
  ```sh
  crontab -e
  ```

  - Add the following line to run the security script every day at 3 AM:
    ```sh
    0 3 * * * /path/to/security_check.sh
    ```
