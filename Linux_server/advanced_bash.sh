# Advanced Bash Scripting

## Construct Compound Commands Using `&&`, `|`, and File Redirects

### Using `&&`
The `&&` operator allows you to run multiple commands in sequence, where each command runs only if the previous command succeeds.

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  mkdir ~/new_directory && cd ~/new_directory && touch new_file.txt
  ```
  This command creates a new directory, changes into that directory, and creates a new file, all in sequence.

### Using `|`
The `|` operator (pipe) allows you to pass the output of one command as input to another command.

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  ls -l | grep "txt"
  ```
  This command lists all files in the current directory and then filters the output to show only files containing "txt".

### Using File Redirects
File redirects allow you to direct the output of a command to a file or use a file as input for a command.

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  echo "Hello, World!" > hello.txt
  cat hello.txt
  ```
  This command writes "Hello, World!" to a file and then displays the contents of the file.

## Create and Save Alias Commands to Your `~/.bashrc` File

Aliases allow you to create shortcuts for frequently used commands.

### Creating an Alias
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  alias ll='ls -la'
  ```

### Saving Aliases to `~/.bashrc`
To make the alias permanent, add it to your `~/.bashrc` file.

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  echo "alias ll='ls -la'" >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```

## Edit `$PATH` Variables to Include a Custom `~/scripts` Directory

The `$PATH` variable specifies the directories where the system looks for executable files.

### Adding a Custom Directory to `$PATH`
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/scripts' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```

## Create Simple Bash Scripts Composed of a List of Commands

Bash scripts allow you to automate tasks by writing a series of commands in a file.

### Creating a Simple Bash Script
1. **Create a new script file**:
   ```bash
   touch ~/scripts/my_script.sh
   ```

2. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/scripts/my_script.sh
   ```

3. **Edit the script file and add commands**:
   ```bash
   nano ~/scripts/my_script.sh
   ```

   - **Example Script**:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "Updating system..."
     sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
     echo "System update complete."
     ```

4. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   ~/scripts/my_script.sh
   ```

## Read Bash and Interpret Scripts

Bash scripts are read and interpreted line by line by the Bash shell. Each line in the script is executed in sequence.

### Example Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

## Use Variables in Your Bash Scripts

Variables allow you to store and manipulate data within your scripts.

### Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
name="John"
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

## Use `if` Statements in Your Bash Scripts

`if` statements allow you to execute commands conditionally based on the evaluation of an expression.

### Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ -f /etc/passwd ]; then
  echo "The passwd file exists."
else
  echo "The passwd file does not exist."
fi
```

## Use Lists in Your Bash Scripts

Lists allow you to store multiple values in a single variable.

### Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry")
echo "First fruit: ${fruits[0]}"
echo "All fruits: ${fruits[@]}"
```

## Iterate Through Lists with a `for` Loop to Do Useful Things

`for` loops allow you to iterate through lists and perform actions on each item.

### Example: Install a List of Packages
```bash
#!/bin/bash
packages=("curl" "wget" "git")
for package in "${packages[@]}"; do
  sudo apt-get install -y $package
done
```
