### 01. **Managed Processes with the `top`, `ps`, and `kill` Commands**

Managing processes is an essential task for system administrators. Linux provides several tools for monitoring and managing running processes.

#### Example 1: Using `top` to Monitor Processes

1. **View Active Processes with `top`:**

   The `top` command provides a dynamic real-time view of the system's processes.

   ```bash
   top
   ```

   This shows a list of processes, their CPU and memory usage, and other information like uptime and load.

   - To exit `top`, press `q`.

#### Example 2: Using `ps` to View Processes

1. **List All Processes with `ps`:**

   To display a snapshot of all the current running processes, use:

   ```bash
   ps aux
   ```

   - `a` shows processes from all users.
   - `u` shows the user-oriented format.
   - `x` includes processes that donâ€™t have a controlling terminal.

   This lists processes with their PID (Process ID), user, CPU usage, memory usage, etc.

#### Example 3: Kill a Process Using `kill`

1. **Kill a Process Using `kill`:**

   To terminate a process, first identify its PID (e.g., from `ps aux` or `top`), then use:

   ```bash
   sudo kill <PID>
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   sudo kill 1234
   ```

   This sends a termination signal (`SIGTERM`) to the process with PID 1234.

2. **Forcefully Kill a Process Using `kill -9`:**

   If the process doesn't terminate with a regular `kill` command, you can force it using:

   ```bash
   sudo kill -9 <PID>
   ```

   - `-9` sends the `SIGKILL` signal to immediately terminate the process.

### 02. **Explored Concepts of RAM and CPU Components**

Understanding the hardware components like RAM and CPU is important for managing a system efficiently.

#### Example 1: Checking RAM Usage

1. **Display Memory Usage with `free`:**

   The `free` command provides information about system memory usage.

   ```bash
   free -h
   ```

   - `-h` stands for human-readable format (e.g., MB, GB).
   
   This displays total, used, free, shared, and available memory, as well as swap usage.

2. **View Memory Usage in Detail with `vmstat`:**

   For more detailed memory statistics:

   ```bash
   vmstat
   ```

   This shows statistics about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, and CPU activity.

#### Example 2: Checking CPU Usage

1. **Display CPU Information with `lscpu`:**

   The `lscpu` command provides detailed information about the CPU architecture.

   ```bash
   lscpu
   ```

   This lists the number of CPUs, cores, threads, architecture, and other details about your CPU.

2. **View Real-Time CPU Usage with `top`:**

   In `top`, CPU usage is shown under the `%CPU` column, which indicates how much processing power each process is consuming.

   - You can press `1` in `top` to view detailed information about each CPU core if the machine has multiple cores.

### 03. **Installed Packages Using `apt`**

The `apt` package manager is used for handling packages on Debian-based distributions (like Ubuntu).

#### Example 1: Update Package Lists

1. **Update Package Lists:**

   Before installing any packages, update the list of available packages with:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

#### Example 2: Install a Package

1. **Install a Package Using `apt`:**

   To install a package (e.g., `curl`), use the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install curl
   ```

   - This installs the `curl` package and any required dependencies.

#### Example 3: Remove a Package

1. **Remove a Package Using `apt`:**

   To uninstall a package (e.g., `curl`), use:

   ```bash
   sudo apt remove curl
   ```

   - This removes the package but may leave configuration files.

2. **Completely Remove a Package Including Configuration Files:**

   To completely remove a package, use:

   ```bash
   sudo apt purge curl
   ```

#### Example 4: Upgrade Installed Packages

1. **Upgrade All Packages to the Latest Version:**

   To upgrade installed packages, run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

### 04. **Worked with Terminator, Utilizing More Advanced Options**

`Terminator` is a terminal emulator that allows for multiple terminals in one window. It supports advanced features like splitting terminals and custom configurations.

#### Example 1: Install Terminator

1. **Install Terminator:**

   To install Terminator, use the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install terminator
   ```

#### Example 2: Splitting Terminals in Terminator

1. **Open Multiple Terminals:**

   - Right-click and select "Split Horizontally" or "Split Vertically" to split the terminal window.
   - You can also press `Ctrl + Shift + E` to split vertically or `Ctrl + Shift + O` to split horizontally.

2. **Resize and Navigate Between Terminals:**

   You can resize the panes and navigate between them using the `Ctrl + Shift + Arrow` keys.

#### Example 3: Configure Terminator Preferences

1. **Access Preferences:**

   To customize your Terminator experience, open Preferences by right-clicking in the Terminator window and selecting "Preferences".

2. **Customize Appearance:**

   In the Preferences window, you can change the font, color scheme, and other settings to suit your preferences.

#### Example 4: Launch Terminator with a Specific Layout

You can launch Terminator with a predefined layout using:

```bash
terminator --layout=your_layout
```

Where `your_layout` is a saved layout you created in Terminator's preferences.
