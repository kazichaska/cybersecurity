### Tips for Practicing:
1. **Keep Data Persistent**  
   Add a volume to persist changes:
   ```bash
   docker run -it -v $(pwd)/data:/root/data --name ubuntu-practice ubuntu:latest
   ```
   This mounts a directory from your host machine to `/root/data` inside the container.

2. **Install Missing Tools**  
   You can install additional tools in the container as needed:
   ```bash
   apt update && apt install -y vim curl
   ```

3. **Use `--rm` for Disposable Containers**  
   If you don't need persistence, use `--rm` to clean up the container after exiting:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm ubuntu:latest
   ```
